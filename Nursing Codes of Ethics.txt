<h1> <p style="color:#1169B4";> 4 Ethical Principles in Nursing</h1>
<h2> <p style="color:#FF0000";> Autonomy</h2>
<p>Autonomy is recognizing each individual patient's right to self-determination and decision-making. As patient advocates, it is imperative that nurses ensure that patients receives all medical information, education, and options in order to choose the option that is best for them. This includes all potential risks, benifits, and complications to make well-informed decisions. </p>
<h2> <p style="color:#FF0000";> Beneficence</h2>
<p>Beneficence in nursing is acting for the good and welfare of others and including such attributes as kindness and charity. The American Nurses Association defines this as "actions guided by compassion." </p>
<h2> <p style="color:#FF0000";> Justice</h2>
<p>Justice is that there should be an element of fairness in all medical and nursing decisions and care. Nurses must care for all patients with the same level of fairness despite the individual's financial abilities, race, religion, gender, and/or sexual orientation. </p>
<h2> <p style="color:#FF0000";> Nonmaleficence</h2>
<p>Nonmaleficence is to do no harm. This is the most well-known of the main principles of nursing ethics. More specifically, it is selecting interventions and care that will cause the least amount of harm to achieve a beneficial outcome. The principle of Nonmaleficence ensures the safety of the patient and community in all care delivery. </p>
